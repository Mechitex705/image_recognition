# Radiology Diagnostic Image Retrieval Software
## Project Overview
This software is designed to assist radiologists and clinicians by allowing them to upload scanned radiological images and automatically receive similar images with diagnostic insights. The system uses AI-based image recognition to find cases with similar patterns, providing further diagnosis and insights based on previous medical cases.
## Features
## 1. Image Upload & Search
* Users can upload radiological images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) in formats such as DICOM, JPEG, and PNG.
* Once uploaded, the software processes the image and uses AI or pattern-matching techniques to find similar cases in the database.

## 2. AI-Powered Image Matching
* The software uses a machine learning model to analyze the uploaded images and find similar cases in the database. It matches patterns, abnormalities, or features in the image and 
  returns the closest matches.
## 3. Diagnostic Insights
* Along with the matched images, the system provides diagnostic insights and possible outcomes based on the history of similar cases, giving clinicians valuable information to guide 
 their diagnosis.
## 4. Search by Image Features
* Users can search for similar cases by entering key features or conditions (e.g., "Tuberculosis," "Lung Cancer"), helping them find solutions faster.
## 5. Case History Management
* Users can manage a history of their uploaded cases, view matched images, and access diagnostic insights for future reference.
## 6. User Authentication
* Secure login system to ensure that only authorized professionals can upload images or view sensitive diagnostic data.
## Tools for software development
* **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React
* **Back-End:** PHP for processing user inputs and managing image uploads
* **Database:** MySQL for storing user information, images, and case histories
* **AI/ML Component:** Python (TensorFlow/Keras) for image recognition and diagnostic pattern matching
* **Hosting:** Scalable hosting solutions (e.g., Linode, AWS, or Google Cloud)

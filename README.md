# Radiology Diagnostic Assistance Platform
## Project Overview
This project is designed to assist radiologists in solving diagnostic challenges by allowing them to upload complex radiological images and automatically find similar cases or potential diagnoses. It leverages an AI-powered search tool to help identify patterns and solutions based on previously uploaded images and diagnoses, providing valuable insights without requiring collaboration from other users.
## Features
## 1. Image Upload & Search
* Users can upload radiological images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) in formats such as DICOM, JPEG, and PNG.
* Once uploaded, the software processes the image and uses AI or pattern-matching techniques to find similar cases in the database.
## 2. Automated Diagnostic Suggestions
* The platform uses a machine learning model to analyze the uploaded images and suggest potential diagnoses based on pattern recognition from previously solved cases.
## 3. Search by Image Features
* Users can search for similar cases by entering key features or conditions (e.g., "Tuberculosis," "Lung Cancer"), helping them find solutions faster.
## 4. Case History Management
* Users can keep a history of their uploaded cases and view past suggestions or matches made by the system.
## 5. User Authentication
* Secure login system to ensure that only authorized professionals can upload images or view sensitive diagnostic data.
## Tools for software development
* **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React
* **Back-End:** PHP for processing user inputs and managing image uploads
* **Database:** MySQL for storing user information, images, and case histories
* **AI/ML Component:** Python (TensorFlow/Keras) for image recognition and diagnostic pattern matching
* **Hosting:** Scalable hosting solutions (e.g., Linode, AWS, or Google Cloud)
